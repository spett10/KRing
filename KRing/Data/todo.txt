-encrypt the hashed of the users password.

-find a nicer way to build it (remove the iff that checks what files to access?)

-cut off password length to 70 bytes to deter DOS attacks? (not relevant, but good practice)

-look after and remove unneccesary password in plaintext strings. 

increase the keylength of AES to 256 ( i think its only 128 standard?)

FIX:

-The #IFDEBUG in the constructores are kinda ugly. Find a better way to make sure the test files are used, and not production files?
