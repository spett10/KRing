-Add keyderivation to encryption/decryption instead of using user password/hardcoded password. (perhaps use PK RSA key to encrypt symmetric key and store it?)
-dont store user in dB, make a DB for each user?  
-We should check for duplicates when user adds domain (only one password per domain?)
-make UI for password retrieval nicer (rite now its ugly)
-we need error handling. When writing to and from DB we should try / catch it all so we dont crash each time if user disturbs database

-implement update
-implement delete

-implement more users / i.e more users in profile, or more profile files one ofr each user?
	-similarly one db for each perhaps?

-implement installing new user / deleting user etc. 

BUG: When we decrypt and store in DB, something goes wrong with decoding? I.e we get a lot of \n\n\n\n it seems, and the stringcompare on view passwords fails..
Something is wrong with encoding, or padding, or something? Very fucky.. 
	i think it happens when we "reencrypt", ie write back the same stuff we just read? Dont think it happens the first time..
