-Add keyderivation to encryption/decryption instead of using user password/hardcoded password. (perhaps use PK RSA key to encrypt symmetric key and store it?)
-make UI for password retrieval nicer (rite now its ugly)
-we need error handling. When writing to and from DB we should try / catch it all so we dont crash each time if user disturbs database


-implement more users / i.e more users in profile, or more profile files one ofr each user?
	-similarly one db for each perhaps?

-use asyn file reading and await it finishing before user can do operations. 


-use more interfaces and refactor st. we can unit test the stuff.
