-use more interfaces and refactor st. we can unit test the stuff.


POST MORTEM:

-Our inversion of giving the UI to the controllers (and even the repository) got quite messy. I think it should be the other way - we hand over
the data and objects to the UI, and then it generates an appropriate view to the user. 

On the other hand, it seems okay that the controllers manipulate the view as they do. I just dont like that htey have these hardcoded messages to the user in the controller.

We could make a template system? But no reason to make it more complicated than it needs to be - its just a fuking command line interface after all.
