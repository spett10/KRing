-Add keyderivation to encryption/decryption instead of using user password/hardcoded password.
-Use IV for each entry added to DB, not one IV for all of them? 
-dont store user in dB, make a DB for each user?  
-remove DTO, since they are equal now.
-DBcontroller.write should check amount of entries before attempting write? 

-use CryptoWrapper in DBController to encrypt and decrypt:
	-take data and encrypt it
	-then convert to base64 so we dont loose data
	-Then write it to a file

	conversely
	-read lines ass base64 stirng
	-then decrypt it. 
	-then convert to ascii. 

-use mapping when reading and creating entries on startup?

-Use IV for EACH SINGLE PROPERTY ENCRYPTED! If you use the same iv you can see if domain and
password are equal (we need semantic security)
