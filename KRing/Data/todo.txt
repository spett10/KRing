-make UI for password retrieval nicer (rite now its ugly)
-we need error handling. When writing to and from DB we should try / catch it all so we dont crash each time if user disturbs database
-Make password checking for new user? (i.e must have special characters and whatnot. )
-use asyn file reading and await it finishing before user can do operations. 
-use more interfaces and refactor st. we can unit test the stuff.
