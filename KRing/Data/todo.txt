-we need error handling. When writing to and from DB we should try / catch it all so we dont crash each time if user disturbs database
-Make password checking for new user? (i.e must have special characters and whatnot. )
-use more interfaces and refactor st. we can unit test the stuff.
-look into unit of work pattern, and transactionScope


-Async file access doesnt make sense since we dont have a UI thread in a console application.
