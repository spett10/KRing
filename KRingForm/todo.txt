1. Add Username to storedpassword and in the view etc.. 
2. Make App.config point to different files dependent on build (debug vs release) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3004210/app-config-transformation-for-projects-which-are-not-web-projects-in-visual-stud
3. Enable you to point to a folder that is the storage - this way, you can put the folder in dropbox, and have 2 computers point to the same data folder, its synced automatically, not dangerous since everything is encrypted. Brilliant
11. Make textboxes listen to keystrokes instead of copying the plaintextpassword which is obfuscated with **** in gui. Listen for events and inspect keystrokes?
15. consider having a k1 that is derived from user password and salt (update for each time?). Then, use that to encrypt/decrypt the symmetric key used for encrypting the passwords.
Then we can change password for the user, but not need to change the key used for encrypting all the entries, so we dont need to reencrypt. 
23. Should we derive a masterkey, then derive the two needed keys from that key? I think that is better practice.
28. Make an icon for the buld thingie.
29. Integration / automated UI tests with AutoIT scripting?
29.5: Import functionality. Point to a folder to "load". If it has the correct structure and format, overwrite current stored stuff with what we read. 
Require master password to confirm? 
30. backup functionality. or export or something. copy data and import data so we dont have to copy paste.
	-export to a zip? Not needed. Just export to a folder. And import a folder. If files are not called what they should, then abort. Then its easier to update.
	Require password when reloading? 
31. folder structures for the main view. 
32. Remove the empty debug folder when we build release (post build scripting)
